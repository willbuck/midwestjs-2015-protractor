# How do I only choose 5-10 core things?

Prioritize: what is most critical?

note:
- This can be a good exercise in general to understanding "what provides the **most** value to me / my users"
- For twitter, it's probably posting a text tweet, retrieving your following list's tweets, following a new user, and ads showing up
- DMs, profile settings, lists, these are way less critical most likely
