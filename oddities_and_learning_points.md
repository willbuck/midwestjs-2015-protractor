# Places I got stuck:
- What type of thing exactly is the 1st argument in .filter(elem, index) ? 
- Have to new up Page Objects in the beforeEach
- When do I have to use promises?

# Thoughts and opinions:
- can I use vscode & definitely typed to help? yes, helpful!
- Brittle in non-angular land? 
- Slow-ish, definitely
- by.buttonText is very sensitive :( partialButtonText is helpful in this case but need to be wary
- Why do I have an angular site I have to mark as non-angular? Is it a webpack thing?
