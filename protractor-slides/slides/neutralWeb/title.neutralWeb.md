# Sites Without Angular

YES, YOU CAN!

note:
- You can test ANY website with Protractor, despite it being tailored for Angular
- Any combination of css, html and js you can reach with a browser, you can write tests for
- Some things are a little less ideal without angular, but overall I found it very useful
