##  I like to code

![Walking Desk](img/walking-desk.jpg "This is a real project on instructibles, go to http://www.instructables.com/id/Hamster-Wheel-Standing-Desk/")

note:
    - Standing desks rock, this is what I strive for though
	- Full stack a little over 5 years now (primarily groovy)
	- TDD for most of that
    - Angular for 2+	
    - Open minded to try new tech but fall back to what I know to get things done
