##  Promises

![KeepPromises](img/keep-promises.jpg "Jingle All The Way is a favorite of mine, and was filmed right here in MSP")

note:
    TODO not sure what I'll talk about here yet other than w/ non angular app testing I struggle with 
    which promises I need to use then for my expects, which I don't but can, and which I can't.
