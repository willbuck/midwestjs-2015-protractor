#What I did today:
- Ran the whole presentation to double check time, w/ some decent pauses to take notes I was right at 50 minutes
- Have some things to add and some things I can speed up with practice

#Tomorrow:
- Fix repeaters in prizeotron tests
- Make all the changes I have in my notes

#Future TODO:

## Week of 10th
- *Hopefully* just practice and polish! Maybe if I add more scope I'll encroach on this
- Part of polishing! Add a Readme.md to each sub-folder

#Potentially scrapped for being overly ambitious:
- Try writing actual protractor directive as angular app & testing it
- Use fixed window sizes to check angles?

- Create an 'order' of commits to follow for live-coding
- Practice live-coding

- Experiment with benchpress (would rather nail down Angular content)

- Testing route changes
- Testing directives extensively
- MockHttpBackend (I'll still try bt it isn't looking good)

## Maybe able to get done at work and report back? 
- Using Cucumber (because ATDD ALL THE THINGS!)

## Countdown: 5 days to presentation!
