# NO ONE
# Should have to be afraid to share what they learn

note:
- Two second rant here, but you're my captive audience XD
- This should be a welcoming community
- But harassment really happens and that sucks
- I have a lot of priviledge as a large straight white guy who got on the job training from really smart people
- People of marginalized groups need to feel welcome
- Regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation
- We have a lot to learn from diverse perspectives
- It will help us make better software
- So what can you do to help this happen?
