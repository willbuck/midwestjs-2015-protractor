#Past:
x MidwestJS

  x Wrote speakers tests
  x Wrote me tests w/ clicks
  x Wrote navigation tests for twitter
  x Refactor into some page objects

#Tomorrow:
- Prize-o-tron
  - mock httpBackend?

#Ongoing:
- Write slides (a little progress each day)
  - Need more on withAngular
  - Comment on httpBackend mocking? 

#Future TODO:

## Week of 13th
- Prize-O-Tron:
  - Figure out how to mock out $httpBackend call

## Week of 20th
- Setup all tests on SnapCI or CodeShip & link on github page
- Work out some logical *suites* (note its on a per-file basis)

## Week of 27th
- Experiment with benchpress
- Try to test a directive myself
- Try to test routing myself

## Week of 3rd
- Polish slides into final presentation
- Practice it at least once (it's been enough in the past eh?)
- Add my twitter handle & bit.ly link to the slides gh-pages

#Potentially scrapped for being overly ambitious:
- Try writing actual protractor directive as angular app & testing it
- Use fixed window sizes to check angles?

- Create an 'order' of commits to follow for live-coding
- Practice live-coding

## Maybe able to get done at work and report back?
- Using Cucumber (because ATDD ALL THE THINGS!)

## Countdown: 27 days to presentation!
