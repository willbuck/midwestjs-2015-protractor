## How do I even selector?

![So confused](img/IDontEven.jpg "")

NOT with `by.model`, I'll tell you that

note:
- Many examples show uses of by.model or by.binding or by.repeater
- Regular websites don't have these angular-specific concepts
- We'll be getting some sugar from protrator, but you'll essentially be doing webdriver w/ promises
- What do I mean by that?
