# Speak up & amplify voices

note:
- It may seem hard to solve the big problem that is discrimination and uncivil behavior
- But these are two small ways you can help change our culture
- Be welcoming of new ideas
- Speak up when you see someone being inappropriate or close-minded
- Amplify the voices of those with diverse perspectives that you respect and admire
