# DONE:
x MidwestJS
  x Wrote first test
  x Wrote speakers tests
  x Wrote me tests w/ clicks
  x Wrote navigation tests for twitter
  x Refactor into some page objects
  x Check angles

x Set self up in VSCode w/ DefinitelyTyped references

x Prize-o-tron
  x PageObject & tests confirming existence
  x Winner picking is exhaustive (not going to test randomness)
  x Reset functionality

x Snap-ci
  x Actually running my protractor tests
  x move protractor install to root so we can run the midwest-js specs as well
  x Work out some logical *suites*, but on a per-file basis (TODO can it we do individual test methods without Cucumber?)

#What I did today:
- Figured out using screenshots that tests failing on SnapCI are due to missing secrets! D'oh, how should I fix that though? 
- Fixed a broken slide I found while demoing presentation to Prime Academy cohorts
- Got re-acquainted with the Frontend Masters app from last week... maybe I should re-do it to be simpler?

#Tomorrow:
- Re-create or rework simple FrontEndMasters app to be easier to test 

#Ongoing:
- Write slides (a little progress each day)
  - Need more on withAngular
  - Comment on httpBackend mocking?
  
- Prize-o-tron
  - mock httpBackend? 

#Future TODO:

## Week of 20th

## Week of 27th
- Try to test a directive myself
- Try to test route traversal myself
- MOCK SOMETHING LIKE HTTP BACKEND, THIS IS THE COOL PART!

## Week of 3rd
- Polish slides into final presentation
- Practice it at least once (it's been enough in the past eh?)
- Add my twitter handle & bit.ly link to the slides gh-pages (also *make* the gh-pages)

## Week of 10th
- *Hopefully* just practice and polish! Maybe if I add more scope I'll encroach on this
- Part of polishing! Add a Readme.md to each sub-folder

#Potentially scrapped for being overly ambitious:
- Try writing actual protractor directive as angular app & testing it
- Use fixed window sizes to check angles?

- Create an 'order' of commits to follow for live-coding
- Practice live-coding

- Experiment with benchpress (would rather nail down Angular content)

## Maybe able to get done at work and report back? 
- Using Cucumber (because ATDD ALL THE THINGS!)

## Countdown: 16 days to presentation!
