# That's all!

```
# in one console
webdriver-manager update && webdriver-manager start
# in another
protractor protractor.conf.js
# Or have your conf do both! just omit seleniumAddress &
# Make sure you ran webdriver-manager update
```

note:
- Really pretty easy to get started with
- Mind the conference wifi running npm install if you're trying to follow along though ;)
