x Snap-ci
  x Actually running my protractor tests
  x move protractor install to root so we can run the midwest-js specs as well

#What I did today:
- Ran through all the slides
- Cleaned up notes
- Added slides to the front half 

#Tomorrow:
- Add content to with and without angular portions on

#Ongoing:
- Write slides (a little progress each day)
  - Need more on withAngular
  - Comment on httpBackend mocking?   

#Future TODO:

## Week of 3rd
- Polish slides into final presentation
- Practice it at least once (it's been enough in the past eh?)
- Add my twitter handle & bit.ly link to the slides gh-pages (also *make* the gh-pages)

## Week of 10th
- *Hopefully* just practice and polish! Maybe if I add more scope I'll encroach on this
- Part of polishing! Add a Readme.md to each sub-folder

#Potentially scrapped for being overly ambitious:
- Try writing actual protractor directive as angular app & testing it
- Use fixed window sizes to check angles?

- Create an 'order' of commits to follow for live-coding
- Practice live-coding

- Experiment with benchpress (would rather nail down Angular content)

- Testing route changes
- Testing directives extensively
- MockHttpBackend (I'll still try bt it isn't looking good)

## Maybe able to get done at work and report back? 
- Using Cucumber (because ATDD ALL THE THINGS!)

## Countdown: 12 days to presentation!
