note:
	- Two second rant here
	- This should be a welcoming community
	- But harassment really happens and that sucks
	- I have a lot of priviledge as a large straight white guy who learned from smart people

	- Regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation
	- We have a lot to learn from diverse perspectives
	- It will help us make better software
