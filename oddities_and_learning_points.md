# Places I got stuck:
- What type of thing exactly is the 1st argument in .filter(elem, index) ? 
- Have to new up Page Objects in the beforeEach
- when do I have to use promises?

# Thoughts and opinions:
- can I use vscode & definitely typed to help? looks like maybe but perhaps not as much help as I need
- Brittle in non-angular land? 
- Slow-ish, definitely
