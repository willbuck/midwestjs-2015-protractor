Past:

x Wrote first test

x Wrote speakers tests

x Wrote me tests w/ clicks

x Wrote navigation tests for twitter

x Refactor into some page objects

x Check angles

x Set self up in VSCode w/ DefinitelyTyped references

x Basic tests for Prize-o-Tron

Tomorrow:
- Continue testing prize-o-tron
  - Selection of winners is random, lowers rsvp list, selection can be exhaustive

Ongoing:
- Write slides (a little progress each day)

Future TODO:
- Prize-O-Tron:
  - Figure out how to mock out $httpBackend call

- Setup all tests on SnapCI or CodeShip & link on github page

- Experiment with benchpress

- Polish slides into final presentation
- Practice it at least once (it's been enough in the past eh?)

- Create an 'order' of commits to follow for live-coding
- Practice live-coding

Potentially scrapped for being overly ambitious:
- Try writing actual protractor directive as angular app & testing it
- Use fixed window sizes to check angles?
