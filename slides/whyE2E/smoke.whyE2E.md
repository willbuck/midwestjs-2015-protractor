## Smoke test builds

![Where there's smoke](img/smoke-testing.jpg "There's a fire")

This is an easy win for a CI system!

note: 
- This saved a ton of back and fourth with our QA team
- Empowered them to kick off builds
- Fun fact: the term smoke test is also used in mechanical engineering like the picture here to look for leaks
