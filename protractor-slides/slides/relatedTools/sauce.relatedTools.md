Browser options you don't have to manage!

note:
- Tons of browsers supported
- Means you don't have to manage the browser runtime envs (good bye Windows server / fleet of mobile devices?)
- Useful if you're like us, have to support IE8, and don't want to deal with keeping an IE8 capable machine alive
- (We don't actually use them, but I think it'd help us)
